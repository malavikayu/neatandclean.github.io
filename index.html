       <h4 style="color:PaleVioletRed ;"><b><i>EFFECTS OF UNTIDINESS ON PHYSICAL HEALTH & MENTAL HEALTH</i></b><h4>
         <ol style="color:LightCoral;background-color:MistyRose;"><div>
             <li>Having an untidy or dirty room or living space, can trigger allegries which could have an                      adverse effect on mental health by promoting avoidable stress.</li>
             <li>Diseases like typhoid, hepaptitis and dengue can be mostly avoided by regularly sanitizing                     and maintaining an attentively clean environment.</li>
             <li>Eating healthy and clean is also a part of individual cleanliness, we can drastically                           reduce the spread of diseases like Jaundice, Cholera, Ascariasis, Leptospirosis, Ringworm and many                others by just eating and drinking non- contaminated water and living in hygienic                             conditions.</li>
             <li>It also has various effects on inducing motivation, according to just household observation we                 can see that children or adults working in a messy enivronment tend to have lesser drive or                       motivation to work ad working less or not having the <i>mood</i> will adversely affect their                      mental health again as they feel lazy and incompendent due to the environment.</li>
             <li>the relaxed, nice feeling, the motivation and the confidence all depends on the environment the                person spends time and grows up in. I think we must all know that the envirnoment hugely affects                the productivity and happiness of a person and certain designs and colors have have experimentally                proved to calm or improve the mood of the person, the point here is that an effective lifestye                    requires a tidy and neat environment</li>
